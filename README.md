# Throttle Guard

Throttle Guard is a lightweight and efficient library designed to help developers manage and control the rate of function execution in their applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface for implementing throttling and debouncing mechanisms, ensuring optimal performance and preventing resource overuse.

## Use Cases

Throttle Guard is ideal for scenarios where controlling the frequency of function execution is critical. Common use cases include:

- **Event Handling**: Optimize performance by throttling or debouncing event listeners (e.g., scroll, resize, input).
- **API Calls**: Prevent excessive API requests by limiting the rate of function execution.
- **User Input**: Enhance user experience by debouncing search inputs or form submissions.

## Tech Stack

Throttle Guard is built with the following technologies:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: The core implementation is written in JavaScript with TypeScript support for type safety.
- **Node.js**: Used for development and testing.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Ensures code quality and consistency.
- **Jest**: Provides a robust testing framework for unit tests.
